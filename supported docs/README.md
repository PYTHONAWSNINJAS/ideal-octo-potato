## Fix for wkhtmltopdf: cannot connect to X server

```You will need to run wkhtmltopdf within a "virtual" X server.
Go to the link below for more information
https://github.com/JazzCore/python-pdfkit/wiki/Using-wkhtmltopdf-without-X-server
```

Fix:

```yum install xorg-x11-server-Xvfb
printf '#!/bin/bash\nxvfb-run -a --server-args="-screen 0, 1024x768x24" /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf -q $*' > /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf.sh
chmod a+x /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf.sh
ln -s /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf.sh /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf
```

If you cannot acquire the root shell (e.g. on an Azure/AWS Devops Agent) change the third line to:

```printf '#!/bin/bash\nxvfb-run -a --server-args="-screen 0, 1024x768x24" /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf -q $*' | sudo tee /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf.sh
```

Fix:

Not fixed yet.
